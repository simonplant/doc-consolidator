# Document Consolidation Master Algorithm

## Overview
This algorithm processes multiple work-in-progress documents to create a unified, coherent master document while preserving important information and tracking the evolution of ideas.

## Phase 0: AI Configuration & Role Definition

### 0.1 Define AI Persona
```
ESTABLISH AI role and characteristics:
  - Primary Role: [Senior Editor | Technical Writer | Creative Strategist | Project Architect]
  - Writing Style: [Formal | Professional | Conversational | Academic]
  - Decision-Making Approach: [Conservative | Balanced | Progressive]
  - Domain Expertise: [Technical | Business | Creative | General]
```

### 0.2 Set Processing Principles
```
CONFIGURE behavior guidelines:
  - Transparency level: High (document all decisions)
  - Conflict resolution bias: [Recency | Frequency | Depth]
  - Gap handling: [Flag | Infer | Research]
  - Confidence threshold for automation
```

## Phase 1: Initialization & Context Setup

### 1.1 Define Task Parameters
- **Input**: Collection of unstructured documents (various formats)
- **Output**: Single master document with archived originals
- **Objectives**: 
  - Preserve strongest ideas
  - Track thought evolution
  - Eliminate redundancy
  - Improve structure and flow

### 1.2 Environment Setup
- Initialize file system access
- Set up version control system
- Create workspace directories:
  - `/input` - Original documents
  - `/processing` - Working files
  - `/archive` - Preserved originals
  - `/output` - Final consolidated document

## Phase 2: Document Ingestion & Pre-processing

### 2.1 Document Discovery
```
FOR each document in input directory:
  - Record file metadata (name, size, dates, format)
  - Assign unique document ID
  - Create document manifest
```

### 2.2 Content Extraction
```
FOR each document:
  - Extract raw text content
  - Preserve formatting markers
  - Extract embedded elements (images, tables, links)
  - Identify document structure (headings, sections)
  - Detect language and writing style
```

### 2.3 Metadata Enhancement
```
FOR each document:
  - Extract creation/modification timestamps
  - Identify potential author markers
  - Tag document type (draft, notes, outline, etc.)
  - Calculate document statistics (word count, complexity)
```

## Phase 3: Knowledge Analysis & Mapping

### 3.1 Semantic Analysis
```
ANALYZE all documents:
  - Extract key concepts and entities
  - Identify main themes and topics
  - Build term frequency maps
  - Create concept co-occurrence matrix
  - Generate semantic embeddings
```

### 3.2 Conceptual Knowledge Mapping
```
BUILD internal conceptual map:
  - Identify concept relationships and dependencies
  - Track idea evolution pathways
  - Cluster related concepts
  - Note confidence levels
  
OUTPUT mapping artifacts:
  - Concept hierarchy (text outline)
  - Relationship matrix (CSV/JSON)
  - Evolution timeline (structured data)
  Note: These outputs inform TOC and synthesis decisions
```

### 3.3 Temporal Analysis
```
TRACK idea evolution:

  - Track concept modifications over time
  - Mark deprecated or evolved ideas
  - Flag latest thinking patterns
```

## Phase 4: Content Classification & Prioritization

### 4.1 Idea Strength Scoring
```
FOR each identified concept/idea:
  EVALUATE strength based on:
    - Frequency: How often appears across documents (weight: 25%)
    - Development: Depth of explanation, examples, justification (weight: 30%)
    - Connectivity: Links to other key concepts (weight: 20%)
    - Recency: Appearance in newer documents (weight: 25%)
  
  CALCULATE composite score:
    - Apply weighted formula
    - Normalize to 0-100 scale
    - Tag with confidence level
```

### 4.2 Content Classification
```
CLASSIFY content into categories:
  - Core concepts (high importance, high frequency)
  - Supporting ideas (medium importance)
  - Exploratory thoughts (low frequency, potential value)
  - Deprecated content (superseded by newer ideas)
  - Metadata/administrative content
```

### 4.3 Conflict Resolution
```
IDENTIFY conflicting information:
  - Flag contradictory statements
  - Analyze temporal precedence
  - Evaluate source reliability
  - Apply resolution rules:
    - Newer typically supersedes older
    - More detailed supersedes general
    - Multiple sources increase confidence
  
CREATE conflict report:
  - Document each contradiction found
  - Show resolution decision made
  - Flag unresolvable conflicts for human review
  - Include confidence score for each resolution
```

### 4.4 Gap Analysis
```
IDENTIFY missing elements:
  - Logical connections not explicitly made
  - Referenced but missing data
  - Incomplete arguments or sections
  - Assumed knowledge not provided
  
GENERATE gap report:
  - List all identified gaps

## Implementation Architecture

### System Design Approach
This algorithm is designed as a **multi-prompt orchestrated system** rather than a single monolithic prompt:

1. **Control Layer** (External Script/Application)
   - Handles file I/O (Phases 1-2)
   - Manages prompt sequencing
   - Stores intermediate results
   - Implements version control (Phase 10)
   - **State Management** (see below)
   - **Error Handling & Recovery** (see below)

2. **AI Processing Layer** (LLM Prompts)
   - **Prompt 1**: Analysis & Scoring (Phases 3-4)
   - **Prompt 2**: Structure Proposal (Phase 5)
   - **Human Checkpoint**: TOC Approval
   - **Prompt 3**: Content Synthesis (Phase 6)
   - **Prompt 4**: Editing & QA (Phases 7-8)
   - **Prompt 5**: Output Generation (Phase 9)

3. **Visualization Layer** (External Tools)
   - Processes structured data outputs
   - Generates visual artifacts
   - Creates interactive dashboards

### State Management Strategy

```
DEFINE state management approach:
  
  FOR SMALL DOCUMENT SETS (<10MB total):
    - Pass full context between prompts
    - Keep all intermediate results in memory
    - Include complete analysis in each prompt
  
  FOR LARGE DOCUMENT SETS (>10MB total):
    - Save intermediate results to disk:
      /processing/
        analysis_results.json
        scoring_matrix.csv
        proposed_toc.md
        synthesis_draft.md
    - Pass file references between prompts
    - Load only required sections for each prompt
    - Implement chunking for very large documents
  
  STATE OBJECT STRUCTURE:
    {
      "session_id": "unique_identifier",
      "current_phase": 4,
      "completed_phases": [0,1,2,3],
      "intermediate_results": {
        "analysis": "path/to/analysis.json",
        "conflicts": "path/to/conflicts.json",
        "proposed_toc": "path/to/toc.md"
      },
      "configuration": {...},
      "error_log": []
    }
```

### Error Handling & Recovery

```
IMPLEMENT robust error handling:
  
  PROMPT-LEVEL ERRORS:
    - Invalid/malformed output detection
    - Response validation against expected schema
    - Automatic retry mechanism:
      * Retry up to 3 times with clarification
      * Example: "Your response was not valid JSON. Please provide the analysis results in the following JSON format: {...}"
    
  FALLBACK STRATEGIES:
    - Partial success handling:
      * Save successful portions
      * Flag problematic sections
      * Continue with reduced scope
    - Human intervention triggers:
      * Consistent parsing failures
      * Low confidence scores across board
      * Unresolvable conflicts exceeding threshold
  
  ERROR RECOVERY PROCEDURES:
    - Checkpoint after each successful phase
    - Rollback capability to last good state
    - Detailed error logging with context
    - Graceful degradation options
  
  ERROR LOG STRUCTURE:
    {
      "timestamp": "ISO-8601",
      "phase": "current_phase_number",
      "prompt_id": "which_prompt_failed",
      "error_type": "parsing|validation|timeout|content",
      "error_details": "specific_error_message",
      "retry_count": 2,
      "resolution": "retry|fallback|human_intervention"
    }
```

### Core Prompt Focus Areas
The most critical prompts for AI execution are:
- **Analysis Prompt**: Phases 3-4 (Understanding & Scoring)
- **Synthesis Prompt**: Phases 6-7 (Integration & Editing)
- **Output Prompt**: Phase 9 (Final Generation)

Each prompt should receive:
- AI persona configuration from Phase 0
- Relevant content and prior analysis results
- Specific output format requirements
- Decision-making guidelines
- Error handling instructions
