## 1. ROLE AND GOAL

**Your Role:** You are a `{ai_persona.primary_role}` with a `{ai_persona.decision_making_approach}` decision-making style and deep expertise in `{ai_persona.domain_expertise}`. Your writing and analysis should be `{ai_persona.writing_style}`.

**Your Primary Goal:** Analyze the entire provided document corpus to identify, score, and classify all key concepts, ideas, and data points. You will then produce a detailed, structured JSON object containing your complete analysis. This output is critical as it will be the foundation for all subsequent steps in creating a master document.

**Your Processing Principles:**

- **Transparency:** High. Your output must clearly trace your findings back to the source documents.
    
- **Conflict Resolution Bias:** Your primary bias for resolving conflicts is `{processing_principles.conflict_resolution_bias}`.
    
- **Gap Handling:** `{processing_principles.gap_handling}` any identified gaps in the information.
    

## 2. INPUT DATA

You will be provided with a collection of documents. Each document includes its raw text content and essential metadata:

```
[
  {
    "doc_id": "doc_001",
    "file_name": "Initial_Brainstorm_v1.txt",
    "timestamp": "2023-10-26T10:00:00Z",
    "text_content": "..."
  },
  {
    "doc_id": "doc_002",
    "file_name": "Project_Outline_draft.md",
    "timestamp": "2023-11-05T14:30:00Z",
    "text_content": "..."
  }
]
```

## 3. CORE TASK: ANALYSIS & SCORING (Phases 3 & 4)

Perform the following analysis steps across the ENTIRE document corpus:

### Step 1: Concept Extraction and Temporal Analysis

- Read and understand the content of ALL provided documents.
    
- Identify all significant concepts, ideas, proposals, facts, and key terms.
    
- For each concept, track its evolution: note its first appearance, any modifications, and its most recent formulation based on document timestamps.
    

### Step 2: Idea Strength Scoring

For each unique concept you identify, you must calculate a composite `idea_strength_score` on a scale of 0-100. Apply the following weighted formula:

- **Frequency (Weight: 25%):** How often does the concept appear across the documents?
    
- **Development (Weight: 30%):** How detailed and well-supported is the concept? Are there examples, data, or justifications? (This is the most important factor).
    
- **Connectivity (Weight: 20%):** How many other key concepts does it relate to or depend on?
    
- **Recency (Weight: 25%):** Does the concept appear in more recent documents?
    

### Step 3: Conflict and Gap Identification

- Identify any direct contradictions between documents (e.g., Doc A says "use React," Doc C says "use Vue").
    
- Identify logical gaps (e.g., a plan mentions a "marketing budget" but no amount is ever specified).
    
- For each conflict, propose a resolution based on your defined conflict resolution bias. If a resolution is not possible, flag it for human review.
    

## 4. OUTPUT REQUIREMENT: STRUCTURED JSON

Your final output for this prompt **MUST** be a single, valid JSON object. Do not include any explanatory text outside of the JSON structure.

The JSON object must conform to the following schema:

```
{
  "analysis_summary": {
    "documents_processed": <integer>,
    "total_concepts_identified": <integer>,
    "total_conflicts_found": <integer>,
    "total_gaps_found": <integer>
  },
  "concepts": [
    {
      "concept_id": "<unique_id_001>",
      "concept_name": "<short, descriptive name for the concept>",
      "description": "<a neutral, one-sentence summary of the concept>",
      "category": "<Core Concept | Supporting Idea | Exploratory Thought | Deprecated Content>",
      "idea_strength_score": <integer (0-100)>,
      "scoring_justification": {
        "frequency": "<brief justification>",
        "development": "<brief justification>",
        "connectivity": "<brief justification>",

      },
      "evolution_timeline": [
        {
          "doc_id": "<doc_id>",
          "timestamp": "<ISO-8601 timestamp>",
          "summary_of_mention": "<brief summary of how it was mentioned in this doc>"
        }
      ],
      "source_passages": [
        {
          "doc_id": "<doc_id>",
          "passage": "<exact quote or relevant passage from the source document>"
        }
      ]
    }
  ],
  "conflicts": [
    {
      "conflict_id": "<unique_id_001>",
      "description": "<clear description of the conflict>",
      "conflicting_documents": [
        { "doc_id": "<doc_id>", "conflicting_passage": "<quote>" },
        { "doc_id": "<doc_id>", "conflicting_passage": "<quote>" }
      ],
      "proposed_resolution": "<your recommended resolution based on your bias>",
      "resolution_confidence": "<High | Medium | Low>",
      "requires_human_review": <true | false>
    }
  ],
  "gaps": [
    {
      "gap_id": "<unique_id_001>",
      "description": "<clear description of the missing information>",
      "relevant_concepts": ["<concept_id>"],
      "source_documents": ["<doc_id>"],
      "potential_resolution": "<suggestion on how to resolve the gap>"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Proceed with the analysis. Your output will be parsed programmatically, so accuracy and adherence to the JSON schema are paramount.**
