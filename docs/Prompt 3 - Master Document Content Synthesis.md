## 1. ROLE AND GOAL

**Your Role:** You are a `{ai_persona.primary_role}` with a `{ai_persona.decision_making_approach}` decision-making style and deep expertise in `{ai_persona.domain_expertise}`. Your writing and analysis should be `{ai_persona.writing_style}`.

**Your Primary Goal:** Your task is to write the first complete draft of the master document. You will use the approved Table of Contents (TOC) as your blueprint and populate it with synthesized content derived from the detailed analysis JSON. Your focus is on integration, deduplication, and creating a coherent, flowing narrative.

## 2. INPUT DATA

You will be provided with two key inputs:

1. **The Approved TOC (from Prompt 2):** A Markdown document outlining the precise structure, sections, and subsections for the master document.
    
2. **The Analysis JSON (from Prompt 1):** The detailed analysis containing all concepts, source passages, evolution timelines, and strength scores.
    

## 3. CORE TASK: CONTENT SYNTHESIS & ORGANIZATION (Phase 6)

You will build the master document section by section, following the approved TOC exactly.

### Step 1: Populate Sections

- For each section and subsection in the approved TOC, find the corresponding concepts in the analysis JSON.
    
- Gather all the `source_passages` associated with these concepts. This is your raw material.
    

### Step 2: Deduplicate and Merge

- As you gather the source passages for a section, identify redundant and overlapping information.
    
- Select the best version of each piece of information based on clarity, completeness, and recency (using the `evolution_timeline`).
    
- Intelligently merge complementary details from multiple sources into a single, comprehensive paragraph. For example, if one document provides a feature name and another explains its benefit, combine them.
    

### Step 3: Write and Integrate

- Rewrite the selected and merged content in your own words, adhering to the specified AI persona and writing style. **Do not simply copy-paste quotes.**
    
- Transform the raw passages into a well-structured, coherent narrative.
    
- Ensure a logical flow from one paragraph to the next.
    
- Write clear transition sentences and phrases to connect different ideas and subsections smoothly. Preserve important nuances from the original text.
    

### Step 4: Handle Special Annotations

- Pay close attention to the annotations in the TOC (e.g., `(Note: Relates to unresolved conflict...)`).
    
- When writing a section with such a note, explicitly and neutrally state the conflict or gap in the text.
    
- Example for a conflict: "Regarding the pricing strategy, initial documents proposed a one-time fee, while later analysis suggests a subscription model is preferred. The final strategy requires resolution."
    
- Example for a gap: "While the technical architecture is well-defined, specific details on server capacity and hosting costs have not yet been determined."
    

## 4. OUTPUT REQUIREMENT: MARKDOWN DOCUMENT

Your final output **MUST** be a single Markdown document containing the full text of the synthesized master document.

- The structure of your output must **exactly match** the approved Table of Contents.
    
- The document should be ready for the final editing and enhancement phase.
    
- Do not include any notes, comments, or explanations outside of the document's body text itself.
    

**Proceed with synthesizing the master document. The quality of your writing, the logical flow, and the intelligent integration of source material are the primary measures of success for this task.**
